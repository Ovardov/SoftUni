                <p>The Dancing Monkeys by Aesop A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally great mimics
                    of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils; and when arrayed in their rich clothes and
                    masks, they danced as well as any of the courtiers. The spectacle was often repeated with great
                    applause, till on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts,
                    and threw them upon the stage. The Monkeys, at the sight of the nuts, forgot their dancing and
                    became (as indeed they were) Monkeys instead of actors, and pulling off their masks and tearing
                    their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The dancing spectacle thus came to an end,
                    amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience. </p>
                <p>Moral: They who assue a character will betray themselves by their actions.</p>
