    <p>Large terrestrial mammals with trunks from Africa and Asia</p>
    <p>The <b>elephants</b> are the large mammals forming the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> in the order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>. Three species are currently recognised: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant">African bush elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_forest_elephant">African forest elephant</a> (<i>L. cyclotis</i>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant">Asian elephant</a> (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Elephants are scattered throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South Asia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomphothere">gomphotheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth">mammoths</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon">mastodons</a>.</p>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis">proboscis</a>), used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor">incisors</a> grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column">pillar</a>-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna">savannahs</a>, forests, deserts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh">marshes</a>. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species">keystone species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion">lions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger">tigers</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena">hyenas</a>, and any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae">wild dogs</a>, usually target only young elephants (or "calves"). Elephants have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society">fission–fusion society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy">matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.</p>
    <p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone">testosterone</a>and aggression known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth">musth</a>, which helps them gain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)">dominance</a>and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound">infrasound</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_communication">seismic communication</a> over long distances. Elephant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition">intelligence</a>has been compared with that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate">primates</a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea" title="Cetacea">cetaceans</a>. They appear to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness">self-awareness</a>and show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy">empathy</a> for dying or dead individuals of their kind.</p>
    <p>African elephants are listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species">vulnerable</a>by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species">endangered</a>. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_trade">ivory trade</a>, as the animals are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching">poached</a>for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction">habitat destruction</a> and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal">working animals</a> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus">circuses</a>. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture">popular culture</a>.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>

    <p>The word "elephant" is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a><i>elephas</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive">genitive</a><i>elephantis</i>) ("elephant"), which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_of_names">Latinised</a> form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language">Greek</a> ἐλέφας (<i>elephas</i>) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (<i>elephantos</i>)),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-LSJ-1">[1]</a> probably from a non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages">Indo-European</a> language, likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_language">Phoenician</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-etymology-2">[2]</a> It is attested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek">Mycenaean Greek</a> as <i>e-re-pa</i> (genitive <i>e-re-pa-to</i>) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B">Linear B</a> syllabic script.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-3">[3]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-4">[4]</a> As in Mycenaean Greek, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a> used the Greek word to mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory">ivory</a>, but after the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, it also referred to the animal.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-LSJ-1">[1]</a> The word "elephant" appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English">Middle English</a> as <i>olyfaunt</i> (c.1300) and was borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French">Old French</a> <i>oliphant</i> (12th century).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-etymology-2">[2] </a><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant">Loxodonta</a></i>, the generic name for the African elephants, is Greek for "oblique-sided tooth".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-5">[5]</a></p>
